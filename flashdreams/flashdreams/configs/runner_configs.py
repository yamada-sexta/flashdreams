"""Aggregator for in-tree + plugin-discovered runner configs.

Each in-tree integration's ``config.py`` (or ``config/<variant>.py``)
self-registers its slugs via
:func:`flashdreams.configs.registry.register_runner` at module-import
time, alongside the matching pipeline configs. This module just
imports those config modules for their side effects and exposes
:func:`all_runners`, which layers plugin discoveries on top of the
populated :data:`flashdreams.configs.registry._SUPPORTED_RUNNERS`
registry.

Integrations that haven't been wrapped into a runner stay reachable via
direct per-integration imports
(``from flashdreams.recipes.<name>.config import <NAME>_CONFIGS``) for
serving / tests / programmatic use, but they do not appear here and
are not ``flashdreams-run`` subcommands. Runners are opt-in.

Adding a new in-tree runner:

1. Author ``recipes/<name>/runner.py`` with the :class:`Runner`
   subclass and its :class:`RunnerConfig` dataclass.
2. In the matching ``recipes/<name>/config.py``, define one
   ``RunnerConfig`` literal per shipped variant (each with a
   non-empty ``description``) alongside the pipeline-config literals,
   collect them in a ``<NAME>_RUNNERS`` dict, and loop
   :func:`~flashdreams.configs.registry.register_runner` over its
   items with ``source="builtin"``.
3. Add a one-line ``import flashdreams.recipes.<name>.config`` below
   so this module triggers the side effect at CLI startup. The smoke
   test in ``tests/test_recipe_configs.py`` enforces parity.
