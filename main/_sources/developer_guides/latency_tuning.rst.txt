OmniDreams interactive latency tuning
=====================================

Interactive launch latency has two different components:

- **Model / chunk latency** is the time spent preparing HDMap conditioning,
  running the OmniDreams DiT, decoding the generated chunk, and updating model
  state. This is usually the dominant input-to-visual delay.
- **Video-transport latency** is the time spent delivering already-generated
  frames to a local window or browser. Switching from MJPEG to WebRTC can reduce
  this delivery cost, but it does not make the model generate a chunk faster.

Tune the model path first when the profiler shows per-chunk work dominating.
Tune transport when generated frames are ready quickly but arrive late or unevenly
in the viewer.

Model and backend choice
------------------------

Use the OmniDreams world-model backend for latency work. The raster backend is
useful for scene, control, and presenter debugging, but it does not exercise the
model path and should not be used as a model-latency reference.

The packaged interactive-drive manifests are the supported starting points:

- ``example_world_model.yaml`` is the default single-view configuration at
  ``1280 x 704`` (width x height), 30 FPS, 8 generated frames per steady-state
  block, LightVAE enabled, and native DiT acceleration disabled.
- ``example_world_model_perf.yaml`` is the perf-tuned manifest. It lowers the
  default resolution to ``1168 x 640``, keeps 30 FPS and 8-frame steady-state
  blocks, enables the performance recipe, and requires the native DiT path.

Run the perf manifest only on hosts that can build and load the native extension:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams omnidreams-prepare --perf
   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
       omnidreams-perf local-window \
       --manifest configs/launch_manifest/omnidreams_local_window.yaml

``native_dit_acceleration: required`` is intentional. If the native extension is
not available, startup fails instead of silently falling back to the slower
PyTorch path.

Resolution
----------

Resolution is one of the highest-impact latency knobs because it changes the
amount of HDMap, DiT, and VAE work per chunk. Set it in the world-model manifest:

.. code-block:: yaml

   resolution_wh: [1168, 640]

Both values are ``[width, height]`` and must be positive multiples of 16. The
bundled manifests list tested aspect-compatible examples:

- ``[1280, 704]``
- ``[1168, 640]``
- ``[1024, 560]``
- ``[896, 496]``
- ``[640, 352]``

Lowering resolution reduces per-chunk compute and transport payload size, with
the expected image-quality tradeoff. The raster presenter automatically adopts
the manifest resolution for the world-model backend.

Chunk size constraints
----------------------

Do not treat chunk size as an arbitrary latency knob. The interactive-drive
adapter validates the FlashDreams pipeline at startup:

- The initial conditioning chunk is fixed at 5 frames.
- The public LightVAE single-view recipe used by the bundled manifests supports
  8-frame steady-state chunks.
- Full-VAE single-view recipes support 8- or 12-frame chunks only when the
  matching checkpoint is available.
- The pixel-shuffle single-view branch requires 16-frame chunks and
  ``local_attn_size: 8``. It is not the published interactive-drive tuning path.

At 30 FPS, an 8-frame steady-state chunk covers about 267 ms of generated video.
Reducing video-transport latency cannot remove this model-side chunk granularity.

FP8 and native acceleration
---------------------------

The perf manifest uses the OmniDreams single-view native CUDA extension for the
DiT path:

.. code-block:: yaml

   native_dit_acceleration: required
   native_dit_backend: fp8_kvcache_cudnn
   native_dit_attention_backend: cudnn

Supported manifest values are ``native_dit_acceleration: disabled | auto |
required`` and ``native_dit_backend: fp8_kvcache_cudnn | bf16``. The attention
backend accepts ``auto``, ``cudnn``, ``sparge``, ``sage3``, and ``sage3_fp8``;
the bundled perf manifest pins ``cudnn``.

The native extension requires a source checkout, ``git``, a CUDA toolchain
(``nvcc``) matching the PyTorch build, synced third-party sources from
``omnidreams-prepare --perf``, and a Blackwell-class GPU (SM 12.0) or newer.
The extension builds for ``12.0a`` by default. Use this path on Blackwell and
GB300 systems.

H100 / Hopper systems should use the standard PyTorch CUDA path with native DiT
disabled unless you are deliberately maintaining a compatible native build. That
path is supported, but it is not the same perf path as the published GB300
numbers.

The manifest also exposes an optional native LightVAE FP8 encoder:

.. code-block:: yaml

   native_vae_encoder: fp8

It is disabled in the bundled perf manifest. Enabling it requires
``OMNIDREAMS_LIGHTVAE_FP8_STATE_PATH`` or ``native_vae_fp8_state_path`` pointing
to a calibrated LightVAE FP8 state.

Transport choice
----------------

Pick transport based on where the viewer runs:

- Local Vulkan window: lowest-overhead local presentation when the host has a
  graphics-capable GPU and display stack.
- ``output.stream_mjpeg`` in a local-window manifest: simple browser delivery
  from the same process.
  Use it on compute-only hosts such as GB300 systems without a graphics queue,
  or when a laptop browser views a remote model host.
- ``webrtc`` launch mode: richer browser frontend with WebRTC's lower
  video-delivery latency and streaming gRPC service support. Prefer this for
  product-style remote viewing or multi-client integration.

MJPEG and WebRTC affect video delivery after a frame exists. If the model is
still spending most of the time inside each chunk, use the perf manifest,
resolution, and native-acceleration knobs first.

Profiling and validated reference
---------------------------------

Set ``output.profile_world_model: true`` to enable FlashDreams CUDA-event
profiling for the world-model runtime. Set ``output.sync_gpu_timing: true`` only
when you need raster compute
timings; it synchronizes GPU work and is not a throughput setting.

The validated published reference for interactive-drive latency is the
single-view GB300 table from :doc:`/models/omnidreams`, measured at
``1280 x 704`` resolution:

KV-cache update is off the hot path and excluded from the total. This guide
consolidates the supported latency controls and existing published measurement;
it does not add new end-to-end hardware benchmarking for Hopper, H100,
Blackwell, or GB300 systems.
