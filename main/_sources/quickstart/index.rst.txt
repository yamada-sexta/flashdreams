Get Started
===========

Welcome to FlashDreams! This page will guide you from a fresh checkout
of the repository to a running model. It uses :doc:`NVIDIA OmniDreams
</models/omnidreams>`, the interactive driving world model, as the
example; the :doc:`model gallery </models/index>` lists the run command
for every other model.

Install
-------

FlashDreams uses the ``uv`` Python package manager (`installation
instructions <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_).
With ``uv`` installed, clone the repository and synchronize the
OmniDreams workspace:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams.git
   cd flashdreams
   uv sync --package flashdreams-omnidreams --extra interactive-drive

Most runs need a Hugging Face token. For OmniDreams, use a token with
read access to `nvidia/omni-dreams-models
<https://huggingface.co/nvidia/omni-dreams-models>`_ and
`nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes
<https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-token>

For container, caching, and other environment details, see the project
`README <https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams/blob/main/README.md>`_ and
:doc:`/troubleshooting`.

Run your first model
--------------------

Launch the OmniDreams interactive driving demo. It runs the world model
and streams the generated camera view to a browser over WebRTC:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
       omnidreams webrtc \
       --manifest configs/launch_manifest/omnidreams_webrtc.yaml

Then open ``http://<server-ip>:8089/request_session`` in a browser on the same network
(use ``localhost`` on the same machine). The first launch spends several
minutes loading checkpoints and compiling kernels; later launches reuse
the cached assets.

Inspect the complete resolved runner, launch mode, scenario, and output without
loading checkpoints:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
       omnidreams webrtc \
       --manifest configs/launch_manifest/omnidreams_webrtc.yaml \
       --no-instantiate

See :doc:`/models/omnidreams` for scripted generation, scene variants,
local-window serving, and multi-GPU options. See
:doc:`/api/launch_manifests` for the shared manifest schema.
