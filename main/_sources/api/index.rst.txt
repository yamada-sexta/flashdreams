CLI and API Reference
=====================

Reference pages for the FlashDreams command-line interface and Python APIs.

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: CLI
      :link: cli
      :link-type: doc

      The unified ``flashdreams-run`` entry point: listing runner slugs,
      inspecting a runner's options, and launching single- and multi-GPU
      inference.

   .. grid-item-card:: Core
      :link: core
      :link-type: doc

      The low-level kernels and process-group utilities that
      integrations share: attention, the block-structured KV cache, and
      distributed helpers.

   .. grid-item-card:: Infra
      :link: infra
      :link-type: doc

      The swappable abstractions every integration plugs into: the
      config system, the encoder / diffusion-model / decoder triple, and
      the streaming inference pipeline that drives them.

   .. grid-item-card:: Pipelines and runners
      :link: integrations
      :link-type: doc

      The two public layers a model integration is built from: pipelines
      that define model behavior and runners that define CLI-facing I/O.

   .. grid-item-card:: Serving
      :link: serving
      :link-type: doc

      The runner / pipeline building blocks for integration-driven
      serving, with LingBot-World as the canonical interactive-transport
      reference.
