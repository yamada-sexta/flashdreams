      Official code

Self-Forcing is a text-to-video (T2V) model based on :doc:`Wan2.1 </models/wan21>`.
It uses a training paradigm for autoregressive video diffusion that simulates
inference-time rollout during training with KV caching, reducing the train-test
gap and enabling efficient streaming generation quality.

Requirements
------------

- **Minimum VRAM**: ~24 GB.
- **PyTorch**: >= 2.9.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   # from the repo root
   uv sync --project integrations/self_forcing

Running the method
------------------

To run Self-Forcing, launch one of the registered runner slugs. For
example:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/self_forcing \
       flashdreams-run \
       self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b \
       --prompt "A stylish woman strolls down a bustling Tokyo street, the warm glow of neon lights and animated city signs casting vibrant reflections. She wears a sleek black leather jacket paired with a flowing red dress and black boots, her black purse slung over her shoulder. Sunglasses perched on her nose and a bold red lipstick add to her confident, casual demeanor. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror-like effect that enhances the colorful lights and shadows. Pedestrians move about, adding to the lively atmosphere. The scene is captured in a dynamic medium shot with the woman walking slightly to one side, highlighting her graceful strides." \
       --pixel-height 480 --pixel-width 832 \
       --total-blocks 7

We provide the following variants:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 45 55

   * - Method
     - Description
   * - ``self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b``
     - Official checkpoint.
   * - ``self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-taehv``
     - Official checkpoint. Swap Wan VAE decoder with the faster TAEHV decoder.
   * - ``self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-sink5-window7-rerope``
     - Steady long-rollout preset: static sink=5 + rolling window=7, with
       KVCache-relative RoPE.

For multi-GPU inference, use:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/self_forcing \
       torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --no-python flashdreams-run \
       self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b \
       --prompt "A stylish woman strolls down a bustling Tokyo street, the warm glow of neon lights and animated city signs casting vibrant reflections. She wears a sleek black leather jacket paired with a flowing red dress and black boots, her black purse slung over her shoulder. Sunglasses perched on her nose and a bold red lipstick add to her confident, casual demeanor.

       --pixel-height 480 --pixel-width 832 \
       --total-blocks 7

To inspect all supported CLI arguments and their default values, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/self_forcing \
       flashdreams-run \
       self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b \
       --help

What to expect
--------------

- **Default prompt**: omitting ``--prompt`` uses a Tokyo street-scene
  default. Override with an inline string or a path to a ``.txt`` file.
- **Total blocks**: ``--total-blocks N`` runs ``N`` autoregressive
  chunks. Commands here use ``7`` for a fast demo; the config default
  is ``60`` for full rollouts. See
  :doc:`/developer_guides/inference_pipeline_overview` for what one
  chunk does end-to-end.
- **Outputs**: ``outputs/<runner-slug>.mp4`` (16 FPS, 480×832 by
  default) and ``outputs/stats_<runner-slug>.json``. Override with
  ``--output-dir`` / ``--pixel-height`` / ``--pixel-width`` / ``--fps``.

Measured runtimes on H100 80GB with ``--total-blocks 7``:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 36 32 32

   * - Setup
     - First run (cold)
     - Subsequent runs
   * - 1× H100 PCIe
     - ~6.9 min
     - ~42 s
   * - 4× H100 HBM3 (``torchrun --nproc_per_node=4``)
     - ~8.6 min
     - ~73 s

Cold runs are dominated by the first two AR blocks (Triton autotuning +
CUDA-graph warmup); steady-state blocks are sub-second.

Per-block steady-state on 4 GPUs is ~2× faster (~251 ms vs ~500 ms),
but per-rank autotune + NCCL overhead makes 4 GPUs end-to-end slower
than 1 GPU at ``--total-blocks 7``. Multi-GPU pays off once steady-state
dominates warmup — use it for ``--total-blocks 60+``.

         A close-up shot of a ceramic teacup slowly pouring water into a glass mug. The water flows smoothly from the spout of the teacup into the mug, creating gentle ripples as it fills up. Both cups have detailed textures, with the teacup having a matte finish and the glass mug showcasing clear transparency. The background is a blurred kitchen countertop, adding context without distracting from the central action. The pouring motion is fluid and natural, emphasizing the interaction between the two cups.

         A dramatic and dynamic scene in the style of a disaster movie, depicting a powerful tsunami rushing through a narrow alley in Bulgaria. The water is turbulent and chaotic, with waves crashing violently against the walls and buildings on either side. The alley is lined with old, weathered houses, their facades partially submerged and splintered. The camera angle is low, capturing the full force of the tsunami as it surges forward, creating a sense of urgency and danger. People can be seen running frantically, adding to the chaos. The background features a distant horizon, hinting at the larger scale of the tsunami. A dynamic, sweeping shot from a low-angle perspective, emphasizing the movement and intensity of the event.
