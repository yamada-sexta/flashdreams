      Official code

Cosmos-Predict2.5 is the latest member of the Cosmos World Foundation Models
(WFMs) family. It is a flow-based model that unifies Text2World, Image2World,
and Video2World into a single network and uses Cosmos-Reason1 - a Physical AI
reasoning vision language model - as its text encoder. The model is shipped in
2B and 14B sizes and post-trained for robotics and autonomous-vehicle tasks
through a curated 200M-clip pre-training corpus, model merging, and a new RL
algorithm.

Requirements
------------

- **Minimum VRAM**: ~80 GB.
- **PyTorch**: >= 2.9.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   # from the repo root
   uv sync --project integrations/cosmos_predict2

Running the method
------------------

To run Cosmos-Predict2.5, launch one of the registered runner slugs. For
example:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/cosmos_predict2 \
       flashdreams-run \
       cosmos2-t2v-2b-720p \
       --prompt "A high-definition video captures the precision of robotic welding in an industrial setting. The first frame showcases a robotic arm, equipped with a welding torch, positioned over a large metal structure. The welding process is in full swing, with bright sparks and intense light illuminating the scene, creating a vivid display of blue and white hues. A significant amount of smoke billows around the welding area, partially obscuring the view but emphasizing the heat and activity. The background reveals parts of the workshop environment, including a ventilation system and various pieces of machinery, indicating a busy and functional industrial workspace. As the video progresses, the robotic arm maintains its steady position, continuing the welding process and moving to its left. The welding torch consistently emits sparks and light, and the smoke continues to rise, diffusing slightly as it moves upward. The metal surface beneath the torch shows ongoing signs of heating and melting. The scene retains its industrial ambiance, with the welding sparks and smoke dominating the visual field, underscoring the ongoing nature of the welding operation."

For multi-GPU inference, run the same command under ``torchrun`` (taking
4 GPUs as an example):

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/cosmos_predict2 \
       torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --no-python flashdreams-run \
       cosmos2-t2v-2b-720p \
       --prompt "A high-definition video captures the precision of robotic welding in an industrial setting.

For I2V, run with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/cosmos_predict2 \
       flashdreams-run \
       cosmos2-i2v-2b-720p \
       --prompt "A high-definition video captures the precision of robotic welding in an industrial setting.
