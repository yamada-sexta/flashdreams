      Official code

Causal-Forcing uses Causal ODE or Causal Consistency Distillation to drive
asymmetric DMD as a theoretically correct initialization for real-time
interactive video generation.

Requirements
------------

- **Minimum VRAM**: ~24 GB.
- **PyTorch**: >= 2.9.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   # from the repo root
   uv sync --project integrations/causal_forcing

Running the method
------------------

To run Causal-Forcing, launch one of the registered runner slugs. For
example:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/causal_forcing \
       flashdreams-run \
       causal-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-framewise \
       --prompt "A cinematic closeup and detailed portrait of a reindeer standing in a snowy forest at sunset. The lighting is gorgeous and soft, with a golden backlight creating a warm and dreamy effect. Soft bokeh and lens flares add a magical touch, enhancing the cinematic quality of the image. The reindeer has a gentle expression, its fur glistening in the fading light. The background features a serene snowy landscape with tall trees silhouetted against the orange and pink hues of the setting sun. The color grade is rich and magical, capturing the essence of a winter wonderland at twilight. A close-up shot from a slightly elevated angle." \
       --pixel-height 480 --pixel-width 832 \
       --total-blocks 21

For multi-GPU inference, run the same command under ``torchrun`` (taking
4 GPUs as an example):

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/causal_forcing \
       torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --no-python flashdreams-run \
       causal-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-framewise \
       --prompt "A cinematic closeup and detailed portrait of a reindeer standing in a snowy forest at sunset. The lighting is gorgeous and soft, with a golden backlight creating a warm and dreamy effect. Soft bokeh and lens flares add a magical touch, enhancing the cinematic quality of the image. The reindeer has a gentle expression, its fur glistening in the fading light. The background features a serene snowy landscape with tall trees silhouetted against the orange and pink hues of the setting sun. The color grade is rich and magical, capturing the essence of a winter wonderland at twilight. A close-up shot from a slightly elevated angle." \
       --pixel-height 480 --pixel-width 832 \
       --total-blocks 21

For I2V, run with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/causal_forcing \
       flashdreams-run \
       causal-forcing-wan2.1-i2v-1.3b-framewise \
       --prompt "A cinematic closeup and detailed portrait of a reindeer standing in a snowy forest at sunset. The lighting is gorgeous and soft, with a golden backlight creating a warm and dreamy effect. Soft bokeh and lens flares add a magical touch, enhancing the cinematic quality of the image. The reindeer has a gentle expression, its fur glistening in the fading light. The background features a serene snowy landscape with tall trees silhouetted against the orange and pink hues of the setting sun.

       --image-path https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thu-ml/Causal-Forcing/refs/heads/main/prompts/i2v/26-15/000001.png \
       --pixel-height 480 --pixel-width 832 \
       --total-blocks 21
