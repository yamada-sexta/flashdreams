   </p>

Requirements
------------

- **Minimum VRAM**: ~48 GB.
- **PyTorch**: >= 2.11.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   # from the repo root
   uv sync --project integrations/omnidreams

Generate the default MP4 demo from bundled example data:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run flashdreams-run omnidreams mp4

The command writes ``outputs/omnidreams.mp4``. Use a launch manifest to
override the scenario, rollout length, frame rate, or output path.

Running the method
------------------

To run OmniDreams, launch one of the registered runner slugs. For
example:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/omnidreams \
       flashdreams-run \
       omnidreams \
       --example-data True \
       --example_data_uuid "239560dc-33d1-11ef-9720-00044bcbccac" \
       --total-blocks 20

Sample example-data UUIDs for the inference script are available in the
`nvidia/omni-dreams-samples Hugging Face dataset <https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/omni-dreams-samples/tree/main/data/single_view>`_.

We provide the following variants:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 45 55

   * - Method
     - Description
   * - ``omnidreams``
     - Default single-view 2-step HDMap-conditioned I2V demo and runner.
   * - ``omnidreams-perf``
     - Opt-in compile and CUDA-graph tuning across all pipeline stages.

For multi-GPU inference, use:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/omnidreams \
       torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --no-python flashdreams-run \
       omnidreams \
       --example-data True \
       --example_data_uuid "239560dc-33d1-11ef-9720-00044bcbccac" \
       --total-blocks 20

To inspect all supported CLI arguments and their default values, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/omnidreams \
       flashdreams-run \
       omnidreams \
       --help

Launch the interactive demo
---------------------------

OmniDreams exposes ``webrtc`` and ``local-window`` through the shared
``flashdreams-run <runner> <mode>`` command. WebRTC only requires a
CUDA-capable GPU; local-window additionally requires a display and Vulkan.

The demo requires access to `NVIDIA/flashdreams <https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams>`_
and an ``HF_TOKEN`` with read access to
`nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes <https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes>`_
(scene USDZs) and
`nvidia/omni-dreams-models <https://huggingface.co/nvidia/omni-dreams-models>`_
(checkpoints).

First-time setup:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams.git
   cd flashdreams
   export HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-token>
   uv sync --package flashdreams-omnidreams --extra interactive-drive

Optionally, pre-download scenes and checkpoints so the first launch
isn't blocked on network I/O:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams omnidreams-prepare

Run the WebRTC demo:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
       omnidreams webrtc \
       --manifest configs/launch_manifest/omnidreams_webrtc.yaml

Then open ``http://<server-ip>:8089/request_session`` in any browser on the
same network.

Collision physics, the vehicle speed limit, and the collision visual effect are
disabled by default. Add ``--game-mode`` to enable the speed limit and
collisions with scene actors and static map geometry, along with the collision
visual flare:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams interactive-drive \
       --stream-mjpeg :8080 \
       --game-mode

Combine ``--game-mode`` with ``--disable-visual-flare`` to retain collision
physics without the full-screen collision effect.

.. note::

   **The first launch is slow.** The first time you start the demo, the world
   model spends several minutes in a one-time optimization pass -- checkpoint
   loading, ``torch.compile`` / CUDA-graph capture, and Triton autotuning --
   before the view becomes interactive. The on-screen indicator shows
   ``Loading world model...`` during warmup and then ``Optimizing world
   model...`` while the first generated chunk is autotuned; this phase is
   longest on the perf manifest. Subsequent launches are much faster because
   the compiled kernels and CUDA graphs are cached and reused.

.. note::

   For local-window, set ``output.offload_text_encoder: true`` in a copy of
   ``configs/launch_manifest/omnidreams_local_window.yaml`` to reduce peak VRAM
   usage by ~15 GB, then launch it with the central command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
          omnidreams-perf local-window \
          --manifest path/to/local-window.yaml

   The text and first-frame encoders are run once per scene and freed before the
   diffusion pipeline is built, and the resulting embeddings are cached and
   reused across world-model resets.

   Trade-off: the world model is rebuilt on each scene load instead of staying
   resident, so the first load and scene/variant switches are slower. Prefer it
   when VRAM-constrained; otherwise leave it off for faster switching.

On a GPU with a graphics stack, launch the Vulkan window:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
       omnidreams-perf local-window \
       --manifest configs/launch_manifest/omnidreams_local_window.yaml

The local window's HUD adds a weather-variant selector (clear, rain, snow)
next to the scene picker, so the same scene can be switched between
conditions.

.. note::

   The local window requires a display server and the system OpenGL /
   Vulkan client libraries. On Debian/Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt install -y libx11-6 libxcb1 libgl1 libglx-mesa0 libvulkan1

   A ``Failed to initialize GLFW`` error indicates the display or one of these
   libraries are missing.

Steering wheel and game controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A steering wheel or game controller can be used to control the local window mode.
Any device that Ubuntu detects as a standard game controller
or joystick is viable. We provide a configuration tool to calibrate these:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams interactive-drive-configuration

The demo auto-loads your default profile on subsequent launches. When you
have more than one profile, the configuration tool's start screen lists them
with **Make default** (plus Edit and Delete) buttons -- re-run the tool to
choose which profile ``local-window`` loads by default, tweak a profile
(steering sensitivity, deadzone, buttons, force feedback), or remove one.

**Multiple devices.** A profile can bind controls across several devices --
for example a wheel base plus a separately-connected or different-brand pedal
set. Ctrl+click to select more than one device on the configuration tool's
device page; each control binds to whichever selected device it moves on.

**Force feedback.** The method is auto-detected per wheel: a driver-managed
autocenter spring (Thrustmaster, Logitech) or a self-rendered constant force
(Fanatec, which has no autocenter). FFB needs the vendor's Linux driver and
write access to ``/dev/input/*`` (add your user to the ``input`` group):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Vendor
     - Driver
   * - Thrustmaster
     - Out-of-tree `hid-tmff2 <https://github.com/Kimplul/hid-tmff2>`__ plus a
       wheel-mode init (``hid-tminit``, or ``tmdrv`` for TX / TS-XW), for
       modern wheels (T300RS, T248, TX, T-GT II, TS-PC, TS-XW, …).
   * - Fanatec
     - `hid-fanatecff <https://github.com/gotzl/hid-fanatecff>`__ with the
       base in PC mode (CSL DD, ClubSport, Podium, DD Pro).
   * - Logitech
     - In-kernel ``hid-lg4ff`` or `new-lg4ff
       <https://github.com/berarma/new-lg4ff>`__ (G29, G27, G923 PS); the G920
       and Xbox/PC G923 use the HID++ driver (kernel 6.3+).

Native acceleration (perf manifest)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bundled ``example_world_model_perf.yaml`` manifest runs the DiT and
LightVAE through the OmniDreams single-view CUDA extension
(``native_dit_acceleration: required``), which is faster than the default
PyTorch path. The extension builds against pinned checkouts of CUTLASS,
SageAttention, SpargeAttn, and cudnn-frontend that are not vendored in the
repo. ``omnidreams-prepare --perf`` clones them at their pinned commits into
``integrations/omnidreams/omnidreams_singleview/3rdparty/``:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams omnidreams-prepare --perf

This step only syncs sources; the extension itself compiles on the first
launch that uses the manifest (one-time, a few minutes). It requires a
Blackwell-class GPU (SM 12.0) or newer, a source checkout (the
``omnidreams_singleview`` sources ship only in the git tree, not the wheel),
``git``, and a CUDA toolchain (``nvcc``) matching your PyTorch build. Then
point the demo at the perf manifest:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
       omnidreams-perf local-window \
       --manifest configs/launch_manifest/omnidreams_local_window.yaml

``native_dit_acceleration: required`` makes the manifest fail loudly if the
extension can't build or load, rather than silently falling back to PyTorch.

WebRTC server
-------------

For deployments that require a richer browser frontend with WebRTC's
lower video-delivery latency and a streaming gRPC service for
multi-client setups, the ``webrtc`` launch mode ships a polished HTML5 client
on top of the same OmniDreams pipeline.

.. code-block:: bash

   # from the repo root
   uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
       omnidreams webrtc \
       --manifest configs/launch_manifest/omnidreams_webrtc.yaml

Sample scene UUIDs for the interactive server are available in the
`nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes Hugging Face dataset <https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes/tree/main/scenes>`_.
Each scene ships clear, rain, and snow weather variants as sibling
archives; set ``scenario.scene_variant`` to ``rain`` or ``snow`` in the launch
manifest to serve a specific one (the default is clear weather).

The server may take a few minutes to warm up. Once ready, it prints
``Connect via http://<server-ip>:8089/request_session``.
Here, ``<server-ip>`` is the server IP address you are connecting to
(can use ``localhost`` when running locally).

.. note::

   On a remote or cloud GPU instance (e.g. `Brev <https://www.brev.dev/>`_),
   the server port is usually not reachable at the host IP directly.
   Forward it to your local machine first, then open
   ``http://localhost:8089/request_session``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Brev
      brev port-forward <instance> -p 8089:8089
      # or plain SSH
      ssh -L 8089:localhost:8089 <user>@<host>

Once successfully connected, the browser-based UI looks like this:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="model-video-card" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px auto 14px;">
    <video class="model-video-player" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata">
      <source src="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/flashdreams/assets/omnidreams/omnidreams-webrtc-recording-0529.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
  </div>

.. note::

   If ``/request_session`` loads but the video never appears, the
   browser is likely obfuscating local IPs in WebRTC ICE candidates
   (replacing them with mDNS ``.local`` hostnames), which prevents the
   peer connection from completing. Disable the setting and reload:

   - **Chrome / Edge:** ``chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns`` → **Disabled**, then restart the browser.
   - **Brave:** ``brave://settings/privacy/security`` → *WebRTC IP handling policy* → **Default public and private interfaces**.
   - **Firefox:** ``about:config`` → ``media.peerconnection.ice.obfuscate_host_addresses`` → **false**.
