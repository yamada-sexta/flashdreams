      Official code

CausalWan2.2 is a `FastVideo <https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo>`_-released
14B MoE causal-diffusion variant of Wan 2.2 with 8-step inference.

Requirements
------------

- **Minimum VRAM**: ~112 GB.
- **PyTorch**: >= 2.9.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   # from the repo root
   uv sync --project integrations/fastvideo_causal_wan22

Running the method
------------------

To run Causal Wan2.2, launch the registered runner slug. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/fastvideo_causal_wan22 \
       flashdreams-run \
       fastvideo-causal-wan2.2-t2v-14b \
       --prompt "A stylish woman strolls down a bustling Tokyo street, the warm glow of neon lights and animated city signs casting vibrant reflections. She wears a sleek black leather jacket paired with a flowing red dress and black boots, her black purse slung over her shoulder. Sunglasses perched on her nose and a bold red lipstick add to her confident, casual demeanor. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror-like effect that enhances the colorful lights and shadows. Pedestrians move about, adding to the lively atmosphere. The scene is captured in a dynamic medium shot with the woman walking slightly to one side, highlighting her graceful strides." \
       --pixel-height 480 --pixel-width 832 \
       --total-blocks 7

   uv run --project integrations/fastvideo_causal_wan22 \
       flashdreams-run \
       fastvideo-causal-wan2.2-t2v-14b \
       --prompt "A playful raccoon is seen playing an electronic guitar, strumming the strings with its front paws. The raccoon has distinctive black facial markings and a bushy tail. It sits comfortably on a small stool, its body slightly tilted as it focuses intently on the instrument. The setting is a cozy, dimly lit room with vintage posters on the walls, adding a retro vibe. The raccoon's expressive eyes convey a sense of joy and concentration. Medium close-up shot, focusing on the raccoon's face and hands interacting with the guitar." \
       --pixel-height 480 --pixel-width 832 \
       --total-blocks 7

For multi-GPU inference, run the same command under ``torchrun`` (taking
4 GPUs as an example):

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/fastvideo_causal_wan22 \
       torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --no-python flashdreams-run \
       fastvideo-causal-wan2.2-t2v-14b \
       --prompt "A stylish woman strolls down a bustling Tokyo street, the warm glow of neon lights and animated city signs casting vibrant reflections. She wears a sleek black leather jacket paired with a flowing red dress and black boots, her black purse slung over her shoulder. Sunglasses perched on her nose and a bold red lipstick add to her confident, casual demeanor. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror-like effect that enhances the colorful lights and shadows. Pedestrians move about, adding to the lively atmosphere. The scene is captured in a dynamic medium shot with the woman walking slightly to one side, highlighting her graceful strides." \
       --pixel-height 480 --pixel-width 832 \
       --total-blocks 21
