FlashDreams runs a growing family of world and video models (text-to-video,
image-to-video, camera-controlled, and super-resolution), all through one
consistent command line and Python interface. Browse the models below, pick the
one that fits what you want to make, and follow its card through to the full
method.

Available models
----------------

The models come in three flavors. Streaming and autoregressive generation
methods build a video step by step and stay fast once warmed up, aiming for
sub-second latency per step; bidirectional methods produce a clip in a single
pass and serve as the quality reference for their streaming counterparts; and
super-resolution methods upscale existing frames in chunks, so their latency
scales with output resolution rather than step count. Each card links to that
method's page, where you'll find the exact command to run it, the checkpoint it
uses, and the settings you can tune.
